                    From <span style=font-size:28px;>2000-2017</span>, overdose-associated hospitalization charges in
                    the state of Kentucky totaled
                    <span style=font-size:28px;background-color:#8C0000;>$1.47</span> billion.<br>
                    In these same years, <span style=background-color:#8C0000;font-size:28px>16,858</span> Kentuckians
                    lost their lives to drug

                    OxyContin was the Sackler miracle drug, until it wasn’t. It was aggressively marketed on false
                    claims of low addiction potential and as being safe for the long-term use in the treatment of
                    chronic pain.

                    Kentucky knows bourbon, horses, and pain.<br>
                    Some parts of Kentucky exist so deep in the red bloody hands of the Sacklers that there doesn't seem
                    to be a way around slow-burn addictions, parking lot overdoses, and one death after another.<br><br>
                    Below is a map showing the the average pills distributed on an annual basis per person in each
                    Kentucky county.<br>
                    All of these pills were distrubuted legally in retail and chain pharmacies.<br>
                    The pill count depicts an average count based on annual reports from 2006-2014.<br>

                    It's important to understand that the opioid epidemic was planted, grown, and sewn
                    legally--practically with FDA approval.<br>
                    <span style=font-size:14px;>The FDA gave a special label certifying OxyContin as less addictive than
                        other opioids despite no sound evidence of this.<br>
                        This played a large part in why doctors prescribed so much OxyContin and why pharmacies could
                        dispense it.</span>
